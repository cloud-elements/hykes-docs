# Building the Cloud

We are now at the point of building the cloud. We've installed the CLIs, we've used some of the
CLIs to speed our development to this point, we've described the cloud via a blueprint, and we've
provisioned the cloud (i.e. servers, DNS, TLS). What's left?

## Build <sub><sup>(Estimated time: 30 to 120 minutes)</sup></sub>

```bash
$ cd /path/to/blueprint
$ hykes-engine build
```

That's it!
